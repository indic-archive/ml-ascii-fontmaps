# Malayalam ASCII - Unicode fontmaps

This repository contains ASCII to Unicode character/glyph maps for ASCII Malayalam fonts of the yesteryear. They can be used in applications for converting old ASCII (ISM) text to Unicode.

The maps are `ASCII char: Unicode char` pairs in numbered JSON files. `index.json` maps font names to the respective JSON map file.

The JSON maps have been derived from the maps forked from [@deepushajia/ASCII-Unicode-Converter-for-Malayalam](https://github.com/deepushajia/ASCII-Unicode-Converter-for-Malayalam)

The JSON maps in the repository are licensed under CC0.
